    <h4> Why to get a container home </h4>
    <p> Container homes are about living cozy, freely and debt free. The homes can be built fast and for an affordable price.
        It is a trend to live as simple as you can 
        without a big home, while still adding a twist of style to your tiny home. They are eco friendly and good for the 
        environment. Go buy your container now while prices may go up if you wait.    </p>
